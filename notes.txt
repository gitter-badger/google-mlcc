Descending into ML
------------------
* Std Dev = sqrt( sum( (y - mean)**2 ) / N - 1 )
* Linear model in machine learning: y' = b + w1x1
    - y' is the predicted label
    - b is the bias (y intercept), sometimes w0
    - w1 is the weight of feature 1 (slope)
    - x1 is a feature (known input)
* Model with multiple features might be y' = b + w1x1 + ... + wnxn
* Error is machine learning is "loss"; Algorithm builds a model to
  minimize loss (called empirical risk minimization)
* Mean square error (MSE) = avg squared loss per observation
    1 / N * sum( (y - prediction(x))**2 )
      - (x, y) is an example, x is feature set & y is label
      - prediction(x) is a function of the weights / bias
      - N is the number of examples

Reducing Loss
-------------
* Hyperparams are params that affect machine learning rate
* Get a "direction" within parameter space
* Gradient: derivative of the loss function with respect to weights/biases
    - Tells us which direction to move in order to minimize loss
    - Think parabola with goal as local minimum
* Iterative approach:
    while loss > loss_target:
        - Data in
        - Compute gradient
        - Update model params in direction of negative gradient
        - Re-compute model
        - Check the loss w/ new model
* Small gradient will take forever to reach minimum, large gradient will overshoot
    the minimum
* Ideal "learning rate" (hyperparam for gradient step size) is 1 / f(x)'', the
    inverse of the 2nd deriv of f(x) @ x
* Stochastic Gradient Descent: Compute the gradient over one random example at a time
    - More noisy but faster than batch
* Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: Average gradient/loss of batch of 10-1000
    - Less noisy than stochastic but still more efficient than using whole dataset

First Steps with TensorFlow
---------------------------
* Pandas
    - DataFrame is a relational data table
    - Series is a single column
    - DataFrame from dict of [Column Name]-->[Series]
    - pandas.read_csv()
    - DataFrame.describe(), DataFrame.head()
    - Series.apply(func) to apply complex func to a Series, returning a mask
